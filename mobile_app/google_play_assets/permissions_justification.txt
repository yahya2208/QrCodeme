PERMISSIONS JUSTIFICATION FOR QRME

This document explains why each permission is required by the QRme application.

================================================================================
1. INTERNET (android.permission.INTERNET)
================================================================================
Purpose: Required for core app functionality

Justification:
- User authentication (login/registration)
- Syncing user profile data with our secure backend
- Loading and displaying digital identity information
- Recording QR code scan analytics
- Retrieving service icons and assets

This permission is essential as QRme is a cloud-based digital identity platform.

================================================================================
2. CAMERA (android.permission.CAMERA)
================================================================================
Purpose: QR Code Scanning

Justification:
- Allows users to scan QR codes to view other users' digital identities
- Camera is accessed only when the user initiates a scan
- No images or video are stored or transmitted
- Camera stream is processed locally on-device only

User Control: Camera access can be revoked at any time through device settings.

================================================================================
3. WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE (android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)
   (Android 12 and below only - maxSdkVersion="32")
================================================================================
Purpose: Save QR Code Images

Justification:
- Allows users to download their generated QR codes as image files
- Users can then share these images via other apps or print them
- Only used when user explicitly taps "Download" or "Save" button
- On Android 13+, this permission is not required due to scoped storage

User Control: This is only triggered by explicit user action.

================================================================================
4. READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE (android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)
   (Android 12 and below only - maxSdkVersion="32")
================================================================================
Purpose: Access saved QR code images

Justification:
- Allows the app to access previously saved QR code images if needed
- Required for share functionality on older Android versions
- On Android 13+, this permission is not required

================================================================================
PERMISSIONS NOT USED
================================================================================
The following potentially sensitive permissions are NOT requested:
- Location (GPS/Network location) - Not needed
- Contacts - Not needed
- Microphone - Not needed
- Phone/Call - Not needed
- SMS - Not needed
- Background Location - Not needed

================================================================================
SUMMARY
================================================================================
QRme requests only the minimum permissions necessary to provide its core 
functionality: internet connectivity for cloud sync, camera for QR scanning, 
and storage access (legacy Android only) for saving QR images.

All permissions are used transparently and in accordance with user expectations.
